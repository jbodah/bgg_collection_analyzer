# BggCollectionAnalyzer

a collection analyzer for boardgamegeeks users

## Usage

This gem provides an easy to use interface for querying your collection.
For example, I can find all of the games that I own that have a medium
weight and are recommended with two, and then I can sort those by my rating
(note: `nil.to_i => 0` and represents unrated games):

```rb
bin/console
irb> pp collection.owned.board_game.recommended_with_two.medium.map { |g| [g.user_rating.to_i, g.name] }.sort_by(&:first).reverse
[[10, "Ghost Stories"],
 [9, "Freedom: The Underground Railroad"],
 [9, "Pandemic Legacy: Season 1"],
 [9, "Suburbia"],
 [8, "Race for the Galaxy"],
 [8, "Dominion"],
 [8, "Gears of War: The Board Game"],
 [7, "Seasons"],
